    // Passes data to container from store. Makes the result of reducers available to our container as props

// mapStateToProps will be the first argument for connect
// Connect lets the App component to subscribe to the Redux store update

    // and wraps every action creator in a dispatch call so taht they can be invoked within our container

// Here we are not exporting App, but instead the results of connect
    // Wrapping <App /> with <Provider> in src/index.js made the Redux store available
    // to connect()() calls within child components. This is how mapStateToProps can access the state
// connect has two parentheses because it has two different function calls
    // connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps) returns a function
    // then the second function is called immediately with App passed in as an argument
export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Home)
